Living without refined, industrial sugar is maybe something to strive for. 
However, that doesn’t mean you have to give up delicious treats such as brownies. 
I was inspired today to create a simple no-bake, no-sugar, vegan recipe myself!

The main ingredients I used are fine oats, cacao powder and dates, with a hint of banana. 
These are perfect for dessert or a small snack in between!

## The Ingredients
- 200g fine oats
- 100g cacao powder
- 200 ml plant-based milk
- 250g Medjool Dates
- 2 ripe Bananas
- 30g of sliced almonds
- ½ tsp cinnamon

## The Recipe
In a food processor combine the oats with the indicated quantity of cacao powder. 
Mix together for about 30 seconds and subsequently place the ingredients into a larger 
bowl. The second step consists in mashing the dates and bananas with your favorite kind 
of plant based milk. Mine is the lightly sweetened soya milk from [Alpro] (https://www.alpro.com/cee/products/drinks/soya-plain/light). 
Once these items have reached a syrupy consistency, combine them with the previous mentioned by using a handheld 
electric mixer. After adding in the last items on the list, mix again for a short while and your “dough” 
will be done! While enjoying the delicious smell, coat a square baking tray with a tiny bit of plant-based butter. 
Fold in the raw brownies, place in freezer for about 45 minutes and as a last step cut them into square pieces. 

*Bon Appetite!*
