My boyfriend and I decided to go on a very spontaneous trip to Lake Garda in Italy. 
From family and friends, we heard it is beautiful there. Therefore, it didn’t take us 
long until we were on booking.com searching for a hotel relatively close to the ocean-like lake.

Even though the **[San Marco in Malcesine] (http://www.sanmarcomalcesine.it/it-it/p/1/hotel)** wasn’t advertised as vegan friendly, we decided on this one. 
As I know from experience that with a bit of creativity, I know it is possible to make any vacation vegan.

Driving to Lake Garda is a wonderful experience as the view is just like out of a movie. Surrounded by mountains 
and quaint villages, the water looks amazing. As we arrived at our hotel, which is situated right by the boardwalk, 
we were greeted by very friendly Italian staff, who were happy to show us to our room. The excellent service continued 
into breakfast. I am a religious oatmeal eater in the morning, so muesli seemed like the perfect option for me. 
Even though cow’s milk was the only choice at the buffet, it didn’t take two seconds until we had soy milk at our table. 
Delicious ripe and dried fruit was served every day to top it off. 

If we weren’t exploring Malcesine or surrounding villages such as Lazise and Peschiere del Garda, which are 
lovely by the way, we were enjoying Lake Garda to its fullest. Hours were spent soaking up the sun while 
reading good books and cooling off in the pristine water. When hunger hit us, we went to the local grocery 
store Eurospar to find the perfect light vegan lunch. I usually went for a big salad with an aceto balsamico 
dressing as well as some very tasty fruit, such as plums and raspberries. I don’t know why, but the produce 
in Italy has so much more flavor than the German. Hence, you can imagine my excitement! If you ever decide 
on a trip to Italy, I also recommend trying their bread sticks called Grissinis. I just couldn’t get enough of them. 

Vegan restaurants are still quite uncommon at Lake Garda, but that doesn’t mean that I was left without an 
option at dinner. Quite the opposite in fact. The majority of restaurants there, are Italian, which means 
the menus were full of pasta and pizza. As I am a big fan of the latter and as it is automatically vegan, 
if not topped with cheese or animal products, I had pizza for dinner every night. Without batting an eye, 
the waiters took my order with “no-mozzarella”. I instead went for my favorite combination: mushroom and 
pineapple. The generous serving of the delicious tomato paste took my dinners to another level! Most pasta 
in Italy is also vegan, if it’s not “fresca”. Just ask for the egg-free option and it will for sure be vegan 
friendly. Sauces with a tomato base will most likely not contain any animal products. As the waiters, most 
of the time speak very good English, you will have no issue finding out. By the way: I highly recommend the 
**[Pizzeria Da Pedro] (http://www.dapedromalcesine.com/en/)** in Malcesine. Three out of the four nights we ate there, as the service, location and food 
are all just heavenly! 

Therefore, if you are vegan and looking for a relaxing vacation, I highly recommend you the Lake Garda region. 
I enjoyed every second of it. The lake, the very friendly locals and of course the food were all just what 
I had been hoping for!
