The festive season, in my opinion, is one of the best periods here in Germany. 
The Christmas decorations along with the delicious scents stemming from the quaint 
Christkindlmärkte (Christmas Markets) in each and every city transform an ordinary 
day into something special.

Going along with the same spirit, we decided to make some 
delicious gluten-free vegan pancakes with a sweet filling mainly made up of apples, raisins and nuts!

The first step in making the pancakes consists in mixing together the flour and the pinch of salt. 
Subsequently, add in the soy milk and keep stirring with a whisk until all clumps have dissolved. 
Before adding in the last ingredient, the bananas, mush them into a pulpy consistency with a fork. 
Mix until everything is well combined.

As a next step, coat a pan with a bit of vegetable oil and put on medium heat. While this is heating up, 
use the time to slice the apples in small cubes. Once the desired temperature has been reached, place a 
full ladle of batter into the pan and distribute it quickly to the desired thickness. Each side of the pancake will take about 2 minutes to cook. 

Once all the batter has been used up, turn the temperature down to simmer and place the maple syrup, 
the cinnamon and the apples into the pan. Cook this mixture, while stirring frequently, for about 3 
minutes. After turning off the stove, add in the raisins. Serve the pancakes with the filling along 
with some diced nuts. We also tried them with a bit of yoghurt sprinkled on top of everything, which 
added another interesting and absolutely delicious layer of flavor!

*Bon Appetite!*
