As our vacation is unfortunately slowly coming to an end here on the beautiful island of Bali, 
I decided to sum up my experience of searching for and finding plant-based meals.<!--more-->  During our first 
couple of days, I was made aware of that the typical Balinese culture appreciates a generous amount of meat; 
especially pork and chicken. Dishes such as Babi Guling, roasted suckling pig, and Nasi Goreng, fried rice with 
some kind of meat, are no rarity on menus.  Even though this is the case, I found it relatively simple to completely satisfy my appetite. 

## Sheraton Bali Kuta Resort

After a travel journey of some fifteen plus hours, my boyfriend and I finally checked in to the Sheraton Hotel right on the very popular 
Kuta Beach at around 7 pm local time. As we were both starving we made our way to the main restaurant of the hotel quite quickly. At the
 same time that we were lead to our table, the very friendly service staff asked if we had any special dietary needs. Very gladly I told
 her about me being vegan. To our surprise, we found out that this particular term is almost unheard of on Bali. The decision of not 
 consuming any direct meat is known of, but completely eliminating all animal products seems to be almost foreign. She, however, could 
 not have been more forthcoming as she almost instantly started listing off popular Balinese dishes which could easily be converted into 
 completely vegan ones. The majority of our dinners we enjoyed here, as the food was absolutely amazing. If you ever decide to stay at the Sheraton, 
 I highly recommend asking for vegan fried rice, sushi with pickled turnip and cooked potatoes with sautéed vegetables. For breakfast, 
 I always wished for oatmeal with soy milk. The large assortment of fruit which was continually offered as part of the buffet, perfectly topped it off.
 
## Boost Juice

After a long and beautiful day on the beach, while exploring Kuta, we stumbled upon a small location called [Boost Juice] (http://boostjuiceindonesia.com/). 
As we decided upon a tropical island for our travel destination with an abundance of locally grown food, I was disappointed to taste some not-so-fresh 
components in my “Carribean Green” Smoothie. My boyfriend also unfortunately was not satisfied with his “Two & Five Juice”; mainly because he didn’t 
like the combination of celery with fruit. 

## Local Juice Stands

Therefore, instead of choosing to go to the above mentioned large chain with relatively high prices, I would rather support the locals 
by purchasing freshly made smoothies from them. These cute stands are found all over in Bali and they prepare them right in front of your 
eyes with delicious looking fruit.

## The Seeds of Life 

As of yet, only one day has gone by during which we didn’t find any time for the beach. We instead decided to explore the very popular 
town of Ubud and its surroundings. In the process of getting lost, we stumbled upon a very interesting raw vegan restaurant called [The 
Seeds of Life] (http://theseedsoflifecafe.com/). Hardly containing my excitement, the waitress took our order. We both decided to order smoothies. 
My boyfriend went for the Banana Dharma and me for the [Shangri-La](http://theseedsoflifecafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Smoothies1-728x1024.jpg). 
Even though we both weren’t hungry we also decided to try the [Banana & Maple Pancakes] (http://theseedsoflifecafe.com/cafe-menu#prettyPhoto/4/). All of it 
was absolutely amazing and we of course finished every bite of it.

## Earth Café

After another beautiful day at the Kedonganan Beach, we decided to check out the neighboring city of our hotel Seminyak. 
We were dropped off at the main shopping center Seminyak Square and subsequently to checking out the shops there, we very slowly made our way 
down the main road looking at all of the interesting clothing and jewelry stores. After finding our favourite Balinese fashion brand [7shore] (www.7shores.com/), 
we also discovered another amazing vegan restaurant called [Earth Café] (http://www.earthcafebali.com/), which unfortunately can only be found on Bali. 
Everything we tried was amazing, but the one thing that we absolutely fell in love with is the [Guru Pizza Option 1] (http://www.earthcafebali.com/menu/). 
We agreed to come back a second time to this restaurant just to have this pizza again!
