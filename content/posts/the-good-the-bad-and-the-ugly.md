As you might have guessed, there are many pros, though also some cons, to deciding to go vegan; just as with any 
decision you make in life. Keep on reading to find out which I have already experienced and been made aware of in 
the relatively short amount of time that I’ve been eating plant-based.<!--more--> 

## Feeling Completely Satisfied

Being able to eat what and how much I want is the greatest feeling ever. I am not following any kind of plan or 
trying to stay under a certain number of calories. I simply listen to my body and I have not gained one extra pound. 
Quite the opposite in fact, I have lost a couple since starting this diet. Even though I haven’t done a lot of exercise 
for a while, I am content with the way I look. I have heard many times that the type of food one eats influences a body 
shape a lot more than the exercise one might do. Living an active lifestyle is rather the tip of the iceberg. 

## Eating Healthier

I have had many arguments about whether eating plant based is healthy. From quite a lot of people I have heard that 
the body is unable to obtain all of its necessary nutrients from plants. Surely vegans must have a protein and iron deficiency! 
However, this is a complete myth. An abundance of protein and iron can be found in this particular diet. Take beans as an example
 for protein and dark green leaves such as spinach for iron. 
 
## Stepping away from Animal Cruelty

Contrary to the belief that animal products are manufactured humanely and that they are able to spend a content life in 
nature before they are made to food, actually the majority stem from cruel factory farms. In these, animals are treated 
like objects to churn out products as cost efficient as possible. To put it all in perspective:

	every second in the US, 300 animals are killed just like that.” - The Vegan Atheist – 101 Reasons to go Vegan
	
## Being less wasteful

In our society nowadays, we are made aware of by our parents, by the media how wasteful we are as a whole. We all 
know about the great amount of clean water which an individual needs to shower, take a bath or do the laundry. 
Furthermore, since early childhood it has been engrained into my brain to always turn off the lights when leaving 
the room to reduce my use of energy. The huge amount of water spent in the meat industry is, however, simply overlooked.

> “It takes less water to produce a year’s food for a vegan than to produce a month’s food for a meat-eater” - John Robbin – Diet for a New America

## The Outsider

If you are the only vegan in your family and circle of friends, it is likely to sometimes feel like a nuisance at social 
gatherings. Maybe they will feel overwhelmed planning vegan-friendly meals. However, this can be easily avoided by bringing 
in your individual ideas or simply taking your own vegan options to the get-together. Doing this, might even inspire your 
friends to try a few vegan options themselves!

## Ordering at Restaurants

Depending on where you live, it might prove difficult finding a vegan option on the menu. The German cuisine for instance 
is laden with meat. However, a lot of dishes can be easily converted to a vegan -friendly one. If you feel like eating 
Italian, simply asking for no cheese on a veggie pizza will transform it to a plant-based option, as the dough 
accidentally already does not contain any animal products. Therefore, don’t be afraid to ask, most waiters will be happy to help you!
