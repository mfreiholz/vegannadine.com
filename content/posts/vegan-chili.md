The first step outside of the airport back in Germany indicated to us the drastic change in weather which happened 
while we were vacationing on Bali. Shorts and t-shirts really weren’t the best choice of outfit anymore, we quickly 
realized!<!--more--> Perfectly going along with the cold and rainy day, my mom decided to make the ideal healthy comfort food; 
which for me is chili. I fell in love with her recipe and immediately decided to also share it with you.

## The Ingredients

- 2 cups Basmati Rice
- 1-2 Tbsp Olive Oil
- 1 Package Meat Substitute 
- 2 Onions
- 250g diced Mushrooms
- 2 diced Red Peppers
- 1 can Kidney Beans
- 1 can diced Tomatoes
- ½-1 can pureed Tomatoes 
- Mexican Seasoning to taste



## The Recipe

The first step consists in preparing the rice according to the instructions on the package. 
While it is cooking, add 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil into a frying pan and turn the stove on 
high heat. After it has reached desired temperature, your preferred meat alternative can be added. 
We used the [Feisty Crumble] (http://beyondmeat.com/products/view/feisty-crumble) from Beyond Meat 
and it turned out great. After about 2-3 minutes the onion 
needs to be included. Once this mixture has been on the stove for another 1-2 minutes, the red peppers 
and mushrooms are ready to be put into the pan. Fry everything for another 2 minutes. After that, turn 
down the temperature to low heat and add the last ingredients on the list. Let it simmer for another 
10-15 minutes and it’s ready to serve. Throughout all steps, don’t forget to keep stirring. 

*Bon Appetite!*
