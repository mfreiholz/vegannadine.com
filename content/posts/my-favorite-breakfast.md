Even before I transitioned into a vegan lifestyle, I loved eating oatmeal for breakfast.
It’s delicious, really healthy and keeps you full and satisfied for quite some time.
My study year abroad in Limerick, Ireland a couple of years ago set me off.<!--more-->
For the Irish, it is a breakfast staple and the selection at the grocery store was endless.
I really enjoyed the pre-packaged options on the Island, however moving back to Germany,
I discovered that they had not as much jumped on the bandwagon yet.
For this reason, I started experimenting with my own versions of oatmeal,
or as the Irish call it porridge.

Today, I would like to share with you my absolute favourite recipe.
I would be lying if I would not tell you that I have it almost every day for breakfast.

## The ingredients

- ½ cup of fine oats (zarte Haferflocken)
- ½ cup of either oat- or soy milk which is a little sweetened
- ½ cup of water
- 1/3 cup of frozen blueberries
- 1 ripe banana
- 1 teaspoon of raw cacao powder
- A little of vanilla powder
- A sprinkle of cinnamon

## The recipe

First, start combining the oats, the cacao and vanilla powder; before adding in the liquid.
I like going in this order, because otherwise you might find clumps of cacao in the oatmeal. Straight after,
I add in the plant-based milk and water and mix everything together.
To be honest, I have gotten into the habit of heating it up in my microwave as opposed to on the stove,
because I find it more convenient. I put it on full heat for about 2 minutes.
If you prefer cooking it in a pot, keep the temperature on low to medium heat to avoid burning the milk.
After about 1-2 minutes, I would add in the frozen blueberries.
Keep stirring frequently until you have your desired consistency.
If you, like me, choose to go with the microwave, just add them on top afterwards.
The last step consists of chopping up the banana and placing it over your delicious oatmeal.
I always put a bit of cinnamon on the fruit as I really enjoy the taste, but that step is optional.
The final product will be an amazing experience of delicious flavours!

*Bon appetite!*
