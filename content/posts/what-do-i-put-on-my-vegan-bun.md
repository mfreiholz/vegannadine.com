Having already spent a good chunk of my life in Bavaria, Germany, an important 
thought crossed my mind while transitioning to a vegan diet. As Semmeln (German buns) 
and bread are almost a major food group by itself and are mostly enjoyed with meat and 
dairy products, how was I going to keep living alongside my fellow Bavarians if both 
were no longer an option for me?<!--more-->  Of course, it wasn’t as bad as that, but I did end 
up doing some research for some quick and easy vegan alternatives. Therefore, if you 
are facing the same kind of struggles that I described above, keep on reading!

Thankfully, the vegan way of life has become popular enough in Germany that direct 
substitutes to meat cold cuts and cheese can be bought at known grocery stores such as 
[Rewe] (https://www.rewe.de/) and [Kaufland] (https://www.kaufland.de/). The collection at 
my absolute favourite bio store [Basic] (https://basicbio.de/) also keeps expanding. 
As these alternatives have really aided me in transitioning and I still really enjoy 
them from time to time, I’d like to share with you, in my opinion, the best. 
The brand which stays truest to the original consistency and flavoring is Vevia; 
which I have so far only seen at Kaufland. 

Vegan cheese, however, is a whole different topic. As of yet, I have not found 
one particular type which truly excites me. I have included one from the brand 
[Simply V] (http://www.simply-v.de/produkte/simply-v-geniesserscheiben), which in 
my opinion has a very similar consistency to actual dairy cheese; the taste however 
is quite different. As the thought of consuming products produced by cows no longer 
sounds enticing to me, I actually think this to be a positive. 
During my time spent in Canada, it perfectly made sense to me to have guacamole with 
nachos and hummus as a dip for veggies; such as carrots and broccoli. Putting these 
two products on my bun never really crossed my mind, until I rediscovered them at Kaufland. 
I am obsessed with the type of guac which I included in the picture as the degree of spiciness 
is perfect. Different types of hummus can be bought at the main grocery stores in Germany. 
The one from [Aldi] (https://www.aldi-sued.de/) is my personal favourite. 

All types of jam should by default be vegan. If you are, however, looking for an amazing, 
healthier alternative, then I highly recommend trying the Dattel Klax, which is solely 
sweetened with dates. My boyfriend discovered it at a small local health shop in Augsburg 
and the lady working explained to him that this spread was among the first vegan ones in 
Germany. I also spotted it at Basic Bio shortly afterwards. Peanut and Almond Butter are 
self-explanatory and can be enjoyed by themselves, with jam or my personal favourite combination is with Dattel Klax. 

Do you have any other faves? If so, I would love to hear about them!

Bon Appetite!
