Finding a vegan restaurant in Munich is luckily not a hard task as this city seems to be one of the first in Germany to 
adopt and take part in ongoing trends. The restaurant which at once caught my eye is the [Gratitude Eatery] (http://www.gratitude-restaurant.de/) <!--more-->
in the district Maxvorstadt; partly because its name sounds very similar to the very popular American [Café Gratitude] (http://cafegratitude.com/). 
My boyfriend and I have already been there twice and I have decided to share our impression of it here today, in case you are planning 
on having a vegan dinner in Munich yourself!

## Our first Impression

As we made our way to the eatery, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that this particular area of Munich offers a wide selection of vegan 
cafés, smoothie bars, bio health stores as well as a vegan ice cream parlor. So, if you ever decide to visit or move to this city, I highly 
suggest checking out this area! Anyway, as we arrived the first thoughts that came to my mind were small, quaint and a friendly minimalistic 
interior. We were lucky to have reserved as we found out from the very friendly staff that on this day they were completely booked out. To our 
surprise, the tables were set up quite close together, which is not often the case in Germany, as the Germans generally like their privacy. 
However, as we were seated we were immediately welcomed from very friendly people sitting nearby with amusing small-talk.

## The Food

Part of the reason I wanted to come here was because the menu is 100% vegan. As we browsed through it, we realized that the prices matched 
other vegan or high quality restaurants with a main dish costing between 12 and 14 Euros. The menu isn’t huge with three main dishes, but 
in my opinion they offer something for everyone. During our first visit, my boyfriend and I both had the ravioli which we both really enjoyed. 
As for the portion size, I thought it to be perfect, my boyfriend however went for a second, the Falafels with Hummus, which was another hit! 
The second time there, I ventured out and ordered their Hokkaido Squash Curry. Honestly, I wasn’t a huge fan of the sauce, but the big slice of squash completely made up for it. The seasoning on it was just perfect. 

## To Summarize

I would highly recommend checking out this particular restaurant, making a reservation either on their website or calling them beforehand is 
however essential. Both times we were there it was completely booked out.
