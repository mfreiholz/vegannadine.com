As it is pumpkin season and an abundance of pumpkins can be seen at all grocery stores in Germany, I 
decided to try a new vegan recipe with spaghetti squash. Since pumpkin alone does not really fill one 
up, I chose to top it with a hearty and creamy tomato sauce and a side of plant-based meatballs.<!--more--> 
The already-made falafels had been discovered on my last shopping trip to my favourite [bio shop] (https://basicbio.de/) 
which is widely dispersed in Germany as well as in Austria. A large variety of 
their products can also be found on their [online store] (http://shop.basicbio.de/).

Anyway, let’s get on to the recipe!

## The Ingredients (serves 2-3)
- 1 spaghetti squash
- 1 can diced tomatoes
- ¼ can coconut milk
- 1 onion diced
- 2 tsp tahini
- 1 heaping tsp ajvar
- 1 tsp ground chili
- Pepper, garlic and turmeric to taste
- Falafel balls 


## The recipe

Start by pre-heating the oven to 200°C and cutting the spaghetti squash length-wise in half. 
With a table spoon take out the seeds. Once the oven has reached the desired temperature 
place the pumpkin facing downwards in a baking tray and add a little bit of water. Depending 
on your oven, it will take anywhere between 30 to 45 minutes. Once a fork can easily pierce 
through the flesh, you will know to take it out. Leave it to cool for a couple of minutes and then begin to seperate the flesh with a large fork.
The finished product will be spaghetti-like strands.

I suggest to prepare the tomato sauce while 
the pumpkin is in the oven as it takes some time to simmer. In a small sauce pan add in the 
diced tomatoes, the coconut milk, ajvar and the tahini. Cook on medium heat for about 5 minutes. 
Subsequently, add in the rest of the ingredients and leave on medium heat for another 10 minutes, 
then switch to the lowest setting. The falafels can either be made in a pan with some oil or also in the oven. 

You will end up with a delicious, very healthy and filling meal!

*Bon appetite!*
