At the moment my favourite thing to have for lunch is a big smoothie. When I first got into them, however, I always had 
a feeling that I was never really satisfied. Bonny Rebecca, an awesome Australian Youtuber, had the simple answer.

If you are not content after a meal, it simply did not contain enough calories. As the vegan diet is less nutrient dense 
than one containing animal products, the amount of food a person has to eat needs to be upped. Therefore, instead of my
smoothies containing one lonely banana they now include three to four; depending on my mood. 

Today, I am sharing with you one of my go-to recipes:

## The ingredients:

- 4 frozen bananas
- 1-2 bunches of kale 
- 1 tsp barley grass powder
- 3 dates
- 1 tbsp chia seeds (optional)

## The recipe:
Combine all ingredients except for the chia seeds in your blender of choice. I am at the moment using a NutriBullet; 
which I really like. Blend to obtain your desired consistency. Lastly, stir in the chia seeds. The smoothie will be nutritious 
as well as delicious as the sweetness from the bananas and dates coincides well with the kale. 

*Bon appetite!*
