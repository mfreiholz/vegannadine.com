Who cares if summer is over? Barbecues can also be a thing on cold and rainy days! 
(As long as the BBQ is protected by some kind of roof!)

My boyfriend and I got invited 
over for dinner on such an evening and we decided to bring along a noodle salad which would 
go well with the grilled meat and vegan alternatives. As we all really enjoyed it, I decided to also share it with you.

## The Recipe

Start by boiling water with a pinch of salt in a larger pot for the pasta. 
Once reached, add in the pasta and cook for the suggested amount of time on the packaging; 
while stirring occasionally. Chop up all vegetables to your desired size. Mix them all together 
with the nuts in a large salad bowl. Before adding in the cooked noodles, make sure that they are cooled off. 
If you don’t like the taste of dried tomatoes, I suggest leaving them out as they do have an acquired taste. 
The last step consists in adding the oil and vinegar. As you can see, it is a very quick and easy recipe, 
which nonetheless does not lack a bit in taste!

*Bon appetite!*
