A huge part in my journey to plant-based eating was YouTube. Accidentally, I would stumble upon videos about
vegan recipes, the health benefits from this diet or some rather strange ones about only consuming a very excessive
amount of bananas the whole day.

Ever since I started uni in the year of 2010, I began trying new types of eating "philosophies"; partly
because I became conscious of my weight and figure but also because I suddenly found myself very interested in living a healthy 
lifestyle. Food, non-arguably, plays a big role in this concept.

If you think of a healthy diet, out of the three macro nutrients fat carbohydrates and protein, which should make up the biggest chunk? The 
answer that is most prominent on the internet is protein. I discovered, consuming a good amount of this makes a body
lean and attractive. It is a huge building block in our body, so it must be the most important. Even though I found it true that a protein-dense diet
stopped me from feeling hungry. I still however, after almost every meal, craved something sweet and unhealty. I was never
satisfied. 

I decided this could not be it. I therefore went back online and found a new community of people praising the high fat and low protein
and carbohydrate way of eating. Ultimately, the biggest argument is that consuming a higher amount of this macro nutrient
sends a signal to the body to burn its own excessive fat. After a period of a lot of avocados, nuts, fish and full fat dariy products, 
I found myself feeling more tired than usual and also sometimes had trouble concentrating.

Ever so often, during these years, I would accidentally stumble upon vegan blogs and videos about plant-based recipes and the amazing
benefits of a high-carb, plant diet. At first, I was hesitant, having grown up in Bavaria (Germany) and Canada, eliminating
animal products would be a rather drastic change. Having to find new recipes for all three meals of the day, made me
nervous. The false believe that only consuming food stemming from plants does not satisfy a human also
left me feeling uneasy. However, the video that gave me the final push to go ahead and try drastically eliminating animal
products from my diet was Kalel's Why I'm Vegan + how you can be too. Almost everyone has heard of the animal cruelty
which takes part in our society today. As this is cleverly hidden from the majority of us, only a few of us make the connection 
between the animal's suffering and the piece of meat on the plate. Her video thankfully made it so clear to me that I was shocked 
I had gone through 24 years of my life and never really thought about where and really from whom my dairy and meat products came from. 

The disgust I felt gave me the energy to begin my journey to a 100% vegan diet. I watched the video in the beginning
of November,2015. As Kalel had suggested to slowly transition, that's what I decided to do. Each day on this trip, I have felt
better; more awake, higher levels of energy and the cravings for unhealthy high fat and sugar products drastically reduced. 
I am writing this post on September 11 of 2016. Having eaten no animal products for a few months now, I can honestly
say I have arrived. I have never felt better in my life. So, I encourage everyone to be open-minded and try the vegan
way of life themselves!
