During our last vacation to Bali, I had a spontaneous idea; which I, with the big help of 
my boyfriend, have put into reality during the last couple of months!

As I realized that 
veganism is not yet as heard of in most countries as I thought it to be, I suddenly had the 
desire to play my part in spreading this very powerful message through 100% vegan T-Shirts. 
I have been collecting my ideas for witty, vegan designs ever since I got back from Bali and you can now check them out in my online shop [Vegan Nadine] (https://www.vegannadine.com).

It was very important to me that I only work with companies which produce in a fair-trade manner and 
guarantee a fully plant-based manufacturing process. The next challenge presented itself in finding a 
printing shop which has the same principles and only uses vegan ink. After some extensive research, 
I found the perfect partners and I was able to put my digital ideas on animal-friendly textile.

My biggest wish is to inspire others to think about their eating habits and perhaps also embark on the journey of becoming vegan.

I would be grateful for any kind of feedback!
